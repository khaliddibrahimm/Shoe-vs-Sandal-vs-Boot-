# Shoe-vs-Sandal-vs-Boot-
This project showcases a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implementation in Python for classifying images of footwear into three categories: Shoes, Sandals, and Boots. The goal is to develop an accurate model that can differentiate between these types of footwear based on image data.
